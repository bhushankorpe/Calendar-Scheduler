# Calendar-Scheduler
In this project I have implemented a personal calendar that records one's daily activities. It has the ability to add, modify, display, and delete events on the calendar. Each event will have its start time, end time, a unique event name, and a short description. Linked list is used to store those events to facilitate the above add/modify/display/delete operations.
